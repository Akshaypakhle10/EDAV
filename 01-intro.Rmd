## Everything you need for EDAV

This resource has everything you need and more to be successful with R, this EDAV course, and beyond.

With this resource, we try to give you a **curated collection of tools and references** that will make it easier to learn how to work with data in R. 

We also believe it is important to learn by example, so there are **several walkthroughs** where we work with data and discuss problems as well as some tips/tricks that will help you.

So, this resource provides a **curated list of materials relevant to EDAV** as well as examples that directly relate to the work you will be doing in this course.

We hope this resource serves you well.

## Fun Stuff: R Shirts

I have made a few tshirts so you can show your love for R. Hope you enjoy. 

*P.S. Designing a cool shirt or sticker is a great addition to your community contribution. It has to be cool, though :)*
