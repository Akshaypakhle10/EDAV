## Overview

This section covers how to make Cleveland dot plots. Cleveland dot plots are a great alternative to a simple bar chart, particularly if you have more than a few items. It doesn’t take much for a bar chart to look cluttered. In the same amount of space, many more values can be included in a dot plot, and it’s easier to read as well. R has a built-in base function, `dotchart()`, but since it’s such an easy graph to draw, doing it “from scratch” in *ggplot2* or base allows for more customization.


```{r ggdot, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
library(tidyverse)
# create a theme for dot plots, which can be reused
theme_dotplot <- theme_bw(14) +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
    	axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
        
# move row names to a dataframe column        
df <-  swiss %>% tibble::rownames_to_column("Province")

# create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = Fertility, y = reorder(Province, Fertility))) +
	geom_point(color = "blue") +
	scale_x_continuous(limits = c(35, 95),
		breaks = seq(40, 90, 10)) +
	theme_dotplot +
	xlab("\nannual live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44") +
	ylab("French-speaking provinces\n") +
	ggtitle("Standardized Fertility Measure\nSwitzerland, 1888")
```

The code:

```{r ref.label='ggdot', eval=FALSE}
```

## Multiple dots (using `forcats::fct_reorder2`)


`School Name` is sorted by factor level, which by default is alphabetical:

```{r}
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtr13/StatGraph5293/master/data/SAT2010.csv",
               na = "s")

head(df)

levels(factor(df$`School Name`))

tidydf <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Critical Reading Mean`)) %>%
  sample_n(20) %>%
  rename(Reading = "Critical Reading Mean", Math = "Mathematics Mean",
         Writing = "Writing Mean") %>%
  gather(key = "Test", value = "Mean", "Reading", "Math", "Writing")

head(tidydf)

ggplot(tidydf, aes(Mean, `School Name`, color = Test)) +
  geom_point() + theme_dotplot
```

We use `fct_reorder2()` here to sort `School Name` in ascending order (`.desc = FALSE`) by the *last* factor level of `Test` (Writing):

```{r}
head(levels(factor(tidydf$Test)))

ggplot(tidydf, 
       aes(Mean, fct_reorder2(`School Name`, Test, Mean, .desc = FALSE),
           color = Test)) +
  geom_point() + theme_dotplot
```

To sort by the *first* factor level of `Test` (Math), install the development version of **forcats**:

`devtools::install_github("tidyverse/forcats")`

and change the default sorting function (`last2()`) to (`first2()`):


```{r}
ggplot(tidydf, 
       aes(Mean, fct_reorder2(`School Name`, Test, Mean, .fun = first2, .desc = FALSE),
           color = Test)) +
  geom_point() + theme_dotplot
```
